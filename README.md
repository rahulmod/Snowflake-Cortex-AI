Building Scalable Solutions: Handling Large Result Sets with Snowflake Cortex AI Functions, Cortex API, Hybrid Tables and Caching.

# Snowflake Cortex API
Key Features
1. Native Snowflake Architecture

Uses Snowflake's stored procedures and functions instead of external Python servers
Leverages Snowflake's VARIANT data type for flexible JSON handling
Built-in scalability and performance optimization

2. Cortex AI Integration

Usage Analytics: AI-powered analysis of API usage patterns using SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE
Auto-Documentation: Generates comprehensive API documentation using Cortex
Intelligent Insights: Provides recommendations for performance optimization

3. Core API Components
Tables:

api_endpoints: Configuration and metadata for API endpoints
api_results_cache: Built-in caching system for query results
api_access_logs: Comprehensive logging for monitoring
api_tokens: Token-based authentication system
api_rate_limits: Rate limiting implementation

Stored Procedures:

register_api_endpoint(): Register new API endpoints
execute_api_endpoint(): Execute endpoints with caching
authenticate_api_request(): Handle authentication
check_rate_limit(): Implement rate limiting

4. Advanced Features
API Gateway Function:

Central entry point for all API requests
Integrated authentication and rate limiting
Automatic error handling and logging

Monitoring & Analytics:

Real-time performance dashboards
Health status monitoring
Usage pattern analysis with AI insights

Maintenance:

Log rotation

Usage Examples
Register an API Endpoint:
sqlCALL register_api_endpoint(
    'Get Orders',
    '/api/v1/orders',
    'GET',
    'SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = {{status}} LIMIT {{limit}}',
    'Retrieve orders by status',
    OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('status', 'string', 'limit', 'integer'),
    TRUE,
    100
);
Execute API Call:
sqlSELECT api_gateway(
    '/api/v1/users',
    'GET',
    OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('limit', 10),
    'Bearer your_token',
    '192.168.1.100',
    'Mozilla/5.0'
) as response;
Get AI-Powered Analytics:
sqlSELECT analyze_api_usage() as insights;
